# üßÆ Simple Calculator in Python

This project is a **simple calculator in Python**, developed as part of my learning journey in **programming logic** and Python fundamentals.  
The calculator allows the user to input two numbers, choose an operator, and receive the result of the operation.

## üöÄ What I Learned from This Project
While developing this calculator, I practiced and learned important programming concepts such as:

- **Input and output handling** with the `input()` function.  
- **Type conversion** (strings to numbers) using `float()`.  
- **Error handling** with `try/except` to deal with invalid inputs.  
- **Looping with `while True`** to keep the program running until the user decides to exit.  
- **Conditional structures (`if/elif/else`)** to validate operators and perform the correct calculation.  
- **Good programming practices**, such as validating inputs, checking operators, and providing clear feedback to the user.
